         Service.</p>
         <p>

          <strong>Publicly Available Information</strong>
          </p>
           When you use the Services, certain information is public, such as your public user profile information, mini-reviews, likes,  saves, lists that you create and save, lists of friends and/or followers, and may be searchable by search engines and be shared with or disclosed to third parties, including through our API to a wide range of users and services.

          <p>
          <strong>Determining your location</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          The Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we'll show you a list of nearby locations). This information is NOT shared in a form that is identified with you with others unless you are using a service that they offer.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Sharing Location with the Blisspot app</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          Your real-time location is not shared with anyone on the Blisspot app in a form that identifies you.If you use a service from one of our merchants e.g. providing a mini-review, like or otherwise interact with a place, users may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like mini-reviews, are time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place even though mini-reivews can be posted when you aren't at the place you are leaving a tip about.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Your Location History</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          We store your location history to provide you better quality results. This information is treated as private under any and all circumstances and is NEVER shared. The user can enable/disable location services from their mobile device and use the Static Location service offered by Blisspot App to select any location from a set of predefined locations.</p>
